# Monetary, Credit and Business Cycle relationship with the Event Synchronization method presented by Quiroga, Kreuz and Grassberger.
Measure of synchronization of timeseries using SAS
# # Monetary, credit and business cycle relationship: an empirical approach

The relationship between business, monetary and credit cycles has diferent interpretation in economic theory. However, there have been very few attempts in economic literature to measure the relationship between the diferent cycles.
The core of this paper is to discuss and test diferent theoretical propositions, based on the diferent definitions of the cycles and the methods used to analyze the relationship between them. We will mainly base our analysis on the EventSynchronization method. We will use empirical data from the United Statesavailable for each cycle to test our ideas.
